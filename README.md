# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   Load the food nutrition dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical labels, and normalize the nutritional features using scaling techniques.

2. **Data Splitting**
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing).

3. **Model Training**
   Train a Logistic Regression model using the training dataset to learn the relationship between nutritional features and diabetic suitability.

4. **Model Evaluation and Prediction**
   Test the model on the testing dataset and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Use the trained model to classify food items as suitable or unsuitable for diabetic patients.


## Program:
```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Load the dataset
df=pd.read_csv('food_items (1).csv')
#inspect the dataset
print('Name:Mohamed Mubeen.A')
print('Reg. No: 212225040241')
print("Dataset Overview:")
print(df.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
print(df.info())
X_raw = df.iloc[:,:-1]
y_raw = df.iloc[:,-1:]
scaler= MinMaxScaler()
#Scaling the raw input features
X= scaler.fit_transform(X_raw)
#Create a LabelEncoder object
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
#Encode the target variable
y= label_encoder.fit_transform(y_raw.values.ravel())
#Note the ravel() function flattens the vector


#First, let's split the the training and testing dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify =y, random_state=123)

#L2 penalty to shrink coefficients without removing any features from the model
penalty='l2'

#Our classification problem is multinomial
multi_class='multinomial'

#Use of lbfgs for L2 penalty and multinomial classes
solver= 'lbfgs'

#Max iteration=1000
max_iter=1000

#Define a logistic regression model with the  above arguments
l2_model = LogisticRegression(
    random_state=123,
    penalty=penalty,
    multi_class=multi_class, 
    solver=solver, 
    max_iter=max_iter
)
l2_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred= l2_model.predict(X_test)
print('Name:Mohamed Mubeen.A')
print('Reg. No: 212225040241')
print("\nModel Evaluation:")
print("Accuracy:",accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

#Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix= confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(conf_matrix)
print('Name:Mohamed Mubeen.A')
print('Reg. No: 212225040241')


```
